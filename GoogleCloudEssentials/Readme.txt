[Introductory  6 Steps  5 hours  13 Credits]

In this introductory-level Quest, you will get hands-on practice with the 
Google Cloud’s fundamental tools and services. 
Google Cloud Essentials is the recommended first Quest for the Google Cloud learner - 
you will come in with little or no prior cloud knowledge, and come out with 
practical experience that you can apply to your first Google Cloud project. 
From writing Cloud Shell commands and deploying your first virtual machine, 
to running applications on Kubernetes Engine or with load balancing, 
Google Cloud Essentials is a prime introduction to the platform’s basic features. 
1-minute videos walk you through key concepts for each lab.
