Introductory 5 Steps 4 hours 13 Credits

It’s no secret that machine learning is one of the fastest growing fields in tech, 
and the Google Cloud Platform has been instrumental in furthering its development. 
With a host of APIs, GCP has a tool for just about any machine learning job. 
In this introductory quest, you will get hands-on practice with machine learning 
as it applies to language processing by taking labs that will enable you 
to extract entities from text, and perform sentiment and syntactic analysis 
as well as use the Speech to Text API for transcription.
